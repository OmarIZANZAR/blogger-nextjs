Shielding on a lander can help, too, but it also adds weight to the craft, increasing mission cost.</p><p><strong>Immobilizing </strong><strong>moon dust</strong>: Masten’s lander-protecting technology is called the in-Flight Alumina Spray Technique (FAST), and it creates a solid landing pad below a lander just before it touches down on the surface of the moon.</p><blockquote><em><strong>Large landers could send moon dust and rocks flying at speeds faster than 6,700 mph.</strong></em></blockquote><p>Masten has just completed initial research into the tech, and the results so far are positive.</p><p>“Our analysis determined the FAST concept is feasible for building near-instant landing pads during a lunar descent, even when utilizing an Artemis-scale human lander,” the company <a href=\"https://masten.aero/blog/mitigating-lunar-dust-masten-completes-fast-landing-pad-study/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a>.</p><p><strong>How it works: </strong>The FAST system injects ceramic particles into the engine plume of a lander as it nears the surface of the moon. The plume partially melts the particles, and when they hit the surface, they coat the moon dust and solidify.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/images/2021/10/moon-dust-FAST.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"moon dust\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"672\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"/images/size/w600/2021/10/moon-dust-FAST.jpg 600w, /images/2021/10/moon-dust-FAST.jpg 672w\"><figcaption><em>How the FAST concept works. Credit: Masten</em></figcaption></figure><p>During the recently wrapped study, Masten used its own rockets to simulate moon landings and refine its tech, determining the ideal particle size, deposit rate, landing pad thickness, and more.</p><p>For NASA’s Artemis lander, for example, it recommends depositing a layer of larger alumina ceramic particles first, and then adding a layer of much smaller particles on top of that one.</p><p>The whole deposit and cooling process would take less than 13 seconds.</p><p><strong>The next steps</strong>: The Artemis lander simulation required 410 pounds of particles, and it’s not clear how that (plus the weight of the container holding them) would compare to the weight of shielding needed to protect the craft from moon dust.</p><p>However, Masten says the FAST system would be cheaper than the estimated $120 million it would cost to send smaller spacecraft to the moon so that they could construct a pad for future landers (something <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322567780_Planetary_Basalt_Field_Project_Construction_of_a_Lunar_LaunchLanding_Pad_PISCES_and_NASA_Kennedy_Space_Center_Project_Update\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other researchers</a> are looking into).</p><p>The next step in the research, according to Masten, is to actually test the tech on the moon. After that, it could potentially be applied to landers destined for Mars or other places in space.</p><p><em>We’d love to hear from you!

Everything about your layout and design can be changed, so you're not stuck with yet another clone of a social network profile.</p><p>How far you want to go with customization is completely up to you, there's no right or wrong approach! The majority of people use one of Ghost's built-in themes to get started, and then progress to something more bespoke later on as their site grows. </p><p>The best way to get started is with Ghost's branding settings, where you can set up colors, images and logos to fit with your brand.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/brandsettings.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3456\" height=\"2338\"><figcaption>Ghost Admin → Settings → Branding</figcaption></figure><p>Any Ghost theme that's up to date and compatible with Ghost 4.0 and higher will reflect your branding settings in the preview window, so you can see what your site will look like as you experiment with different options.</p><p>When selecting an accent color, try to choose something which will contrast well with white text. Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements. Vibrant colors with a darker hue tend to work best, as a general rule.</p><h2 id=\"installing-ghost-themes\">Installing Ghost themes</h2><p>By default, new sites are created with Ghost's friendly publication theme, called Casper. Everything in Casper is optimized to work for the most common types of blog, newsletter and publication that people create with Ghost — so it's a perfect place to start.</p><p>However, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can pick out a look and feel that suits you best.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/themesettings.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3208\" height=\"1618\"><figcaption>Ghost Admin → Settings → Theme</figcaption></figure><p>Inside Ghost's theme settings you'll find 4 more official themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.</p><ul><li><strong>Casper</strong> <em>(default)</em> — Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters</li><li><strong>Edition</strong> — A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors</li><li><strong>Alto</strong> — A slick news/magazine style design for creators</li><li><strong>London</strong> — A light photography theme with a bold grid</li><li><strong>Ease</strong> — A library theme for organizing large content archives</li></ul><p>And if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the <a href=\"https://ghost.org/themes/\">Ghost Marketplace</a>, where you'll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.</p><h2 id=\"building-something-custom\">Building something custom</h2><p>Finally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.</p><p>Ghost's theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.</p><p>If you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it's like, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/tryghost/casper/\">browse through the files of the default Casper theme</a>. We've added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-code-card\"><pre><code class=\"language-handlebars\">{{#post}}\n&lt;article class=\"article {{post_class}}\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;\n    \n    {{#if feature_image}}\n    \t&lt;img src=\"{{feature_image}}\" alt=\"Feature image\" /&gt;\n    {{/if}}\n    \n    {{content}}\n\n&lt;/article&gt;\n{{/post}}</code></pre><figcaption>A snippet from a post template</figcaption></figure><p>See?

Suddenly, you're working in a new format.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-xSMqGH7gi6o-unsplash.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"6000\" height=\"4000\"></figure><p>As it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really well.

If you've ever used an email client with a concept of <em>saved replies</em> then this will be immediately intuitive.</p><p>To create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you'd like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you're all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the <code>/</code> command.</p><p>This works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/createsnippet.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2282\" height=\"1272\"></figure><p>You can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.</p><p>Once you get a few useful snippets set up, it's difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.</p><hr><h2 id=\"publishing-and-newsletters-the-easy-way\">Publishing and newsletters the easy way</h2><p>When you're ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the <em>Preview</em> link and you'll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/preview.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3166\" height=\"2224\"></figure><p>You can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the <em>Publish</em> button to decide who to deliver it to.</p><p>Ghost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We've spent countless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all email clients, and performs well for email deliverability.</p><p>So, you don't need to fight the awful process of building a custom email template from scratch. It's all done already!</p><hr><p>The Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a little exploration, you'll be up and running in no time.</p>",

Rather than just endlessly posting and hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work and have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes all this possible is called <em>Portal</em>.</p><p>Portal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site. It works on every Ghost site, with every theme, and for any type of publisher. </p><p>You can customize the design, content and settings of Portal to suit your site, whether you just want people to sign up to your newsletter — or you're running a full premium publication with user sign-ins and private content.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/portalsettings.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2924\" height=\"1810\"></figure><p>Once people sign up to your site, they'll receive an email confirmation with a link to click. The link acts as an automatic sign-in, so subscribers will be automatically signed-in to your site when they click on it. There are a couple of interesting angles to this:</p><p>Because subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as registered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages depending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some posts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a great draw to encourage people to sign up!</p><p>Ghost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no passwords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email subscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site. Like magic.</p><p>Portal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out, clicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in, clicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their name, email, and subscription settings.</p><p>The floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add manual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.</p><p>Like this! <a href=\"#/portal\">Sign up here</a></p><hr><p>As you start to grow your registered audience, you'll be able to get a sense of who you're publishing <em>for</em> and where those people are coming <em>from</em>. Best of all: You'll have a straightforward, reliable way to connect with people who enjoy your work.</p><p>Social networks go in and out of fashion all the time. Email addresses are timeless.</p><p>Growing your audience is valuable no matter what type of site you run, but if your content <em>is</em> your business, then you might also be interested in <a href=\"http://localhost:2368/sell/\">setting up premium subscriptions</a>.</p>",
